# hhdynamics

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

`hhdynamics` is a household transmission model that can fit to the case-ascertained household transmission studies. This model describes the risk of PCR-confirmed infection among household contacts as depending on time since illness. This is an individual-based hazard model that can characterize influenza transmission dynamics within households and estimate the effects of factors affecting transmission. The model is fitted in a Bayesian modeling framework.

While the package currently provides a set of fundamental functions, we are actively working on expanding its capabilities with more advanced tools for a comprehensive understanding of your results.
 
## Installation
1. Install [R][r-project]

2. Install the development version of hhdynamics from [GitHub](https://github.com/timktsang/hhdynamics):

```{r installation,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("timktsang/hhdynamics")
library(hhdynamics)
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to load a data from household transmission study and fitting the model using the MCMC framework.

```{r example, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
library(hhdynamics)

## Load in the example data and the serial interval distribution.
data("inputdata")
data("SI")

###### run the MCMC to estimate parameter of the model
###### in actual analysis, number of iteration is 15000, burnin is 5000, and thinning is 1
fit_hh_model <- household_dynamics(inputdata, inf_factor = '~sex', sus_factor = '~age',SI,n_iteration =  15000,burnin = 5000, thinning =  1)


```
